# Given a string s, find the length of the longest 
# substring without duplicate characters.

# s = "abcabcbb" -> longest substring without repeating = "abc"
# As the longest substring is "abc" hence return length 3

# s = "pwwkew" -> longest substring withour repeating = "wke"
# Hence the longest string length will be 3
